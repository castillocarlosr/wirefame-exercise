# wirefame-exercise

##Purpose
- This is a basic model of building a wireframe template to show what a webpage would look like before adding any content
- Like any project, you must first design a basic blueprint of what project will look like.  This is that basic blueprint.
- This is to show any clients or people looking to make a website what it will look like.

- It may look simple, but this is really where it begins before you start building anything.

#### This is the scaffolding for a front page website.

-Carlos Roberto Castillo
